### Hi, I am Stepfen Shawn, a computer otakuðŸ¥·
I started coding at the age of 13, and I've never been tired of it!    
Now I'm a 18 years old guy from Canton, an Unreal Engine Dev, a Compiler/AI researcher, also a 10x programmer( it's my dream )!!!     
```scheme
(define mylife  () (display "Coding && debugging"))
(define mydream () (display "10x programmer"))
(define myidol  () (list "Matz", "Geohot", "Linus"))
```
