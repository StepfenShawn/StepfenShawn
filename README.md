I started coding at the age of 13, and I've never been tired of it!    
Now I'm a 18 years old guy from Canton (Guangzhou), a python/c++ Dev, also a Compiler & AI researcher !!!     
```scheme
(define mydream () (display " 10x programmer "))
(define mylife () (list " Coding " " Making friends on Github â™‚ " " Reading the f**king source code "))
```
